Scientific studies were highly respected in academic world due to the potential to save humanity. However, profit driven science do not have the same principles. When the true motivation of humanity is replaced with profit, science is nothing but another marketing scheme.

Capitalist society composed of billionaires, politicians and boot licking professionals; have degraded science to unimaginable depth. Only credit worth mentioning is the ability of politicians to continue to deceive the public that science can do no harm to the humanity.

For example, race to build atomic bomb to save humanity was the biggest lie evidenced after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki destruction. Obviously, science community did not save humans or environment. Morality was eroded enough to serve the interest of corporate warfare.

At the same time, science community and ruling powers did not pay attention to the social welfare of Americans. The importance of basic necessity such as food, medicine and housing are held hostage from workers in a so called free country. Do they really care about the welfare of people? No evidence to support the claim.

Credibility of science community funded by the corporations is not high. Politicians were the middle man to transfer tax dollars into the hands of largest pharmaceutical companies and implement coerced vaccinations to mask money laundering; all while under funding social programs.

A nation run by bankers will never be out of debt. A nation owned by weapon manufactures will never know peace. A nation that allows a small segment of its citizens to write laws will never know justice. And if these elements own the media, no one will ever know the truth.
