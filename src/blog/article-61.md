Racism exists because we accept racist standards. Due to imbalance of power, the oppressed cannot challenge the oppressor. After 2000 years, we still have government officials in Poland not shamed to admit racist decisions that were used to deny muslims and African refugees of Ukraine. The ruling class does very little to address racism because division and conquer is the pillars of modern politics. Do we need a class war to free all those oppressed?
