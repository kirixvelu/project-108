<h3>Land Acknowledgement for Scarborough</h3>
<p>
  The land I am standing on today is the traditional territory of many nations
  including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the
  Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First
  Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples. I also acknowledge that Toronto is covered
  by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the Williams
  Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands.
</p>

<p>
  Using and participating in a land acknowledgement is a way to recognize the
  enduring presence and resilience of Indigenous peoples in this area for time
  immemorial. They are also a reminder that we are all accountable to these
  relationships. I dedicate all of my journal entries to my daughter Katherine
  and every child that never returned home from residential schools in Canada
  through 1830 to 1996.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, I am grateful for your interest to learn more about my experiences
  socially, economically and politically in the oppressed age of times. By
  visiting the blog, you agree to respect Scarborough land acknowledgement and
  access all of its content in the same spirit. Learn more about Scarborough

        <a href="/blog/article-95/">Who Controls Toronto - People or Developers?</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
In the 2018 Toronto Municipal Election, 34% of all campaign contributions came from people with ties to the development industry. Many important decisions on the right to housing are being influenced by these donors, to the detriment of regular people in Toronto. An excerpt from Acorn Canada Research.

      </h2>
      <p>
On Tuesday, January 11, 2022 at 7p.m. over 300 front-line workers from coast to coast joined a Zoom Conference in response to the Omicron crisis. The conference host, Justice for Workers Organization, was overwhelmed by the participation and passion of frontline workers from variety of sectors, including health, education, transportation, agriculture and newly emerging freelance/ gig workers. The conference included special guest Ontario New Democratic Party (ONDP) Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Peggy Sattler from London West, guest speaker Dr. Naheed Dosani, and observers from the Migrant Rights Network, along with Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL).

      </h2>
      <p>
When we ask, why most people dislike politics, the answer is pretty obvious. No one likes being lied or asked to believe a false reality. Therefore, working people shy away from politics; which reflects in the statistics that only a small percentage of eligible working people actually vote in local politics. If all the workers actually caste vote, status quo will change in a heartbeat, that is the great nightmare of ruling class.

      </h2>
      <p>
For long time, people on the left and right were divided; however, pandemic closed the gap. Ruling class is on the edge of falling into the ocean; yet, holding onto the greed of wealth by funding the paramilitary structures and wars. Regardless, vaccine mandates elegantly united the left and right in a way that no one have ever imagined. Mask is not the problem, the slavery wage is that both sides now agree except the ruling class.

      <p>
Regardless of political standing, we can all agree that pandemic have exposed many issues in our society. One the core issue was unjust wages that resulted in people earning less and losing more through the pandemic; meanwhile, those at the top get richer. The status quo argument was that CEOs earn their salary but poor workers are not. The conversation took a 360 turn after pandemic where front line workers were working the hardest under dangerous conditions while CEOs were watching Netflix.

      </h2>
      <p>
Despite previous assurances that it would not result in additional costs, a new report says the TTC will spend millions of dollars more on fare collection each year by using the Presto smartcard instead of tickets, tokens and passes. Skeleton in the closet is the breach of privacy and violent enforcement of the broken fare system. An excerpt from Toronto Star.

      </h2>
      <p>
Instead of throwing around fancy terms, we must stop and define all the buzz words. What is inflation? where does it begin? Is it caused by nature? Who wins and who loses? Answering the four questions would set one on the right path to realize inflation is just an economical gimmick to justify the status quo. The buzz word inflation is political forgery to protect the ruling class.

      </h2>
      <p>
The Canadian Museum for Human Rights recognizes that the colonial experience in Canada, from first contact to the present, constitutes genocide against Indigenous peoples. The Indian residential school system was one key component of this genocide.

        <a href="/blog/article-94/">Key Facts About Residential Schools</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
Residential schools were government-sponsored religious schools that were established to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture. Although the first residential facilities were established in New France, the term usually refers to schools established after 1880. Residential schools were created by Christian churches and the Canadian government as an attempt to both educate and convert Indigenous youth and to assimilate them into Canadian society. However, the schools disrupted lives and communities, causing long-term problems among Indigenous peoples. The last residential school closed in 1996. An excerpt from The Canadian Encyclopedia.

        <a href="/blog/article-105/">Brand Politics Legitimize Dictatorship</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
In Canada, we have four mainstream political parties but only two ruled almost the entire time. The red liberal lies and the blue conservative crooks. Although both parties appears to have difficult political platform, in reality, both are just the same with altered words. If we analyze the decisions of each party historically, we would be shocked to know that both parties are just the same brand packaged under different names. Sadly, Obama dropped more bombs, killed more people and replaced legitimate leaders in third world countries than than Trump did.
